            She smiled as he looked into her eyes, <br/>
            Holding hands, they danced. <br/>
            Lights tinkering far away,<br/>
            Perfectly cold it was. <br/>
            He pulled her in,<br/>
            Making her warm. <br/>
            And as music played,<br/>
            Soulfully right it was. <br/>
            Gently walking away,<br/>
            They talked. <br/>
            Promising to never be apart,<br/>
            Whole-fully heartwarming it was. <br/>
            Sitting down suddenly he asked her,<br/>
            If he could put a ring on her finger that night.<br/> 
            With no one around watching,<br/>
            Unknowingly beautiful it was. <br/>
            Holding his face,<br/>
            She looked at him. <br/>
            Telling him she’s his forever,<br/>
            Joyfully happy it was. <br/>
            Silent into the night,<br/>
            Far away from a distance,<br/>
            As I watched, <br/>
            Silently heartbreaking it was.

          <div class="writingtwo"><h3>Standing by thw window</h3>

            Standing by the window I watched, <br/>
            You dancing away to your favourite song,<br/>
            A smile on your face, constant,<br/>
            As I smiled looking at it all along. <br/>
            Beautiful in red, I’d call you,<br/>
            You’d laugh it off and leave,<br/>
            I knew I’d caught your attention,<br/>
            You knew I’d make you see. <br/>
            The life you always wanted,<br/>
            For some reason, let it out on me,<br/>
            You knew I’d make you have it,<br/>
            I knew I’d make you believe. <br/>
            Then I watched you meet her,<br/>
            Then I’d watch you smile,<br/>
            Constant, like she’d put it there,<br/>
            Then I knew you weren’t mine. <br/>
            Standing by the window I watched,<br/>
            You dancing to your favourite song,<br/>
            Holding her hand, constant,<br/>
            As I smiled looking at it all along.<br/> 
            I wished you’d look back,<br/>
            Beautiful in red, I’ll call you,<br/>
            You’ll laugh it off and stay,<br/>
            The way I always wanted you to. <br/>
            Maybe then I wouldn’t stand by and watch,<br/>
            Maybe then I’d be the one you’d hold,<br/>
            Maybe then you’d still smile, constant,<br/>
            And I’d smile looking at it all along.<br/>

            <div class="writingone"><h3>Dance in the dark</h3>
            You asked me to dance in the dark with you, <br/>
            So we’d hold hands all night,<br/>
            Cause we’re both too scared to let go,<br/>
            Of what we thought we’d never have. <br/>
            I agreed and walked in with you,<br/>
            Saw you smile in half,<br/>
            You turned around and held me,<br/>
            Whispering into my heart. <br/>
            You asked me to dance in the dark with you,<br/>
            So we’d hold hands all night,<br/>
            Cause we’re both too scared to let go,<br/>
            Of what we thought we’d never have. <br/>
            You ran your hands across my face,<br/>
            Moving my hair away,<br/>
            You’d always say they hid my smile,<br/>
            Even without the light you’d feel that way.<br/> 
            You asked me to dance in the dark with you,<br/>
            So we’d hold hands all night,<br/>
            Cause we’re both too scared to let go,<br/>
            Of what we thought we’d never have.<br/>
            Resting my face on your heart I’d hear, <br/>
            Beating so fast, I’d know <br/>
            Your smile fading away into silence,<br/>
            I’d hold you tighter, perfectly slow. <br/>
            You asked me to dance in the dark with you, <br/>
            So we’d hold hands all night,<br/>
            Cause we’re both too scared to let go,<br/>
            Of what we thought we’d never have.<br/>

            With the reflecting light, <br/>
            The moon. <br/>
            With an infinite,<br/>
            The intricate knot. <br/>
            With blindness to  unnecessary faults,<br/>
            The Cupid. <br/>
            And with just the beauty of love,<br/>
            The Maple. <br/>
            After so many symbols of love,<br/>
            If I’d to name one;<br/>
            As an honour to all of those combined,<br/>
            I’d name it after you,<br/>
            Cause aren’t you just,<br/>
            All of those, together. :”)
