          I FELL.
          A saviour, you came, <br/>
          Saved me from my own mess.<br/>
          From the morning I did not want to wake up to, to the mornings you <br/>
          made worth getting up for, I fell.<br/>
          From the evenings I sat alone on the terrace listening to the slowest songs<br/>
          to the evenings you sat with me and made those same songs happier, I fell.<br/>
          From the nights I cried myself to sleep to the nights you did not let me, I fell.<br/>
          From the days I would watch the same movies and cry to the days you made me laugh<br/>
          at Augustus Water's driving, I fell.<br/>
          From the times I would cry alone to the times I cried to you, I fell.<br/>
          We fell for each other right when we shouldn't have;<br/>
          We were a mess.<br/>
          You still smiled,<br/>
          You still took care of it, of it all.<br/>
          How could I not fall?<br/>
          How could I let you go?<br/>
          How could I hide it all?<br/>
          You fixed all of the broken pieces in me,<br/>
          You didn't even have to try to, you just did.<br/>
          How was it so easy and so hard at the same time?<br/>
          How did you make me laugh and cry so easily?<br/>
          And then you walked away, like it did not even matter.<br/>
          The void was deeper than it had ever been, deeper than the one you fixed the last time.<br/>
          Who would stop my tears away with lame jokes now?<br/>
          Who is going to stay up at 3am for me now?<br/>
          Who is going to send those ugly pictures to bring a small smile now?<br/>
          Who is going to be the you in me now?<br/>
          I wish we had that one chance, that one chance to make it all right.<br/>
          That one last chance we craved for so long.<br/>
          I wish. <br/>
          I wish you remember me every single time you look at the 1am clock ticking away,<br/>
          just wishing we were together and happy. Just as happy as we made each other back then.<br/>

      // <br/>
        Even if there are a hundred valid reasons not to, <br/>
        I’d find just one right enough to fight for you :”)<br/><br/>

        // <br/>
        I know I love you cause<br/>
        I once started writing about you<br/>
        And couldn’t stop since. <br/><br/>

        //<br/>
        You made me fall for the smallest things,<br/>
        Just the way you made me fall for you,<br/>
        Slowly, piece after piece,<br/>
        So beautifully, as a whole. <br/><br/>

        //<br/>
        You are without a doubt the combined definition of love and peace. <br/><br/>

        //<br/>
        I would rather love you and lose<br/>
        Than not love you at all. <br/>
        I would rather love you with my broken heart<br/>
        Than love someone else with the whole of it. <br/><br/>


        //<br/>
        In a world full of unchosen variables, you’re my chosen constant.<br/><br/>
